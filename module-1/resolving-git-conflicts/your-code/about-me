 Who am I 

 

* Where are you from?  

 

Madrid, although I’m half british 

 

* What do you do?  

 

Currently I teach English online to Chinese students aged 5-13. I’ve done this for the past 3 years, while I travelled (mostly across Asia). Before that I worked in finance in Europe for about 5 years (different locations) in back office/risk management.  

 

* Do you have previous experience with technology/data? 

 

Just the basic MS office package, mostly excel. I used it for reporting, and data quality control, so it was relatively data-intensive.  

 

# Why am I here 

 

* What has brought you to Ironhack? 

 

Teaching was something that allowed me to travel, but I don’t want to keep doing it forever (I think mainly because the financial reward is low). I want to be part of an ambitious enterprise where I can really feel valuable, where my skills are rare and essential. That’s what data analytics represents for me, and it somewhat marries into what I had been doing in finance so it seemed like a natural path to follow. For the past 6 months I’ve been studying the field by myself but I found it quite difficult to structure and scaffold my learning. During this time, Ironhack kept coming up as a good place to master the main skills of the field quickly and effectively.  

 

* What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp? 

 

I want to manage data. Surf the numbers. Be that guy in the company that knows or can find out exactly what is going on with the business. I guess python and SQL are the starting point. If I feel I’m good at them and I like what I’m learning, I would move further from there.  

 

# What will I do after the bootcamp? 

 

* Which industry will you seek employment in?   

 

Perhaps fintech start-ups because my background is in finance, and I’m not interested in in large corporate environments so much. However, it could be in other fields. 

 

* What will your future role look like? 

 

Dynamic, upbeat and young office. The work I do each day is truly needed and has an impact. First as part of a team with good mentoring, and later on possibly more independently.  

 

* What is your career goal? 

 

To work in something that excites me (and pays well J)
